Buzzwords like single-page applications, server side rendering and incremental static regeneration are thrown around in a flurry like anybody has any idea what they're talking about. Today we're gonna clear up that confusion by answering the question: what is Jamstack? And, more importantly, what does it mean for your business?\n\nJamstack, previously notated JAMstack, is shorthand for Javascript, API and Markup stack. It's the bread and butter of modern day web architecture, providing a faster, more scalable and even more secure alternative to its predecessors.\n\nTo understand how Jamstack works, we need to take a closer look at how the web operates.\n\nThe Client and the Server\n\nNote: If you've read our post on PWA's, you can skip this section.\n\nWhen it comes to the web, two key terms are thrown around most frequently. The client and the server.\n\nThe client is any device that you, the user, use to access the web. This might be your smart phone, laptop or tablet.\n\nThe server is where all of the data for a website is stored. Picture those big data centers that you see in movies. Those data centers are filled with lots and lots of servers.\n\nWhen you want to connect to a website, you turn on your device, load up your favorite browser and enter in a URL, say www.netflix.com. Here, your browser (the client) makes a request to the server at Netflix requesting the site data. The Netflix server sends back the data and i displayed on your device.\n\nNote: if you're wondering how your computer knows where the server netflix.com is, we are getting into the Domain Name System (DNS), which is also super cool, but we'll save that talk for another day as it is not important to Jamstack.\n\nData in Interfaces\n\nSo what is this “data” we keep referring to? Data is all of the 1s and 0s that tell your browser how to draw the webpage. Today's word of the day is Rendering.\n\nRendering is the process of taking raw input data, like all of that beautiful code we here at Boxhouse wrote for you, and processing it into the majestic display that ends up on your screen.\n\nThis process of rendering is the core of how Jamstack works. There are four different methods for rendering.\n\nSingle Page Applications (SPA)\nServer Side Rendering (SSR)\nStatic Generation (SSG)\nIncremental Static Regeneration (ISR)\n\nThese terms all differ only in where the rendering step takes place.\n\nIn SPA, the client receives the code from the server and does the rendering itself. On the contrary, SSR is where the server renders the code before sending it over to the client.\n\nAs an example, platforms like Wordpress and Squarespace use server side rendering in their sites.\n\nThe major drawback to both of these processes is that rendering takes time and opens up opportunities for bad actors to inject malicious code. Beyond this, search engines like google don't wait around for the client rendering process when indexing your site. So, SPA's are especially bad for SEO.\n\nWhat can we do about this? Introducing Jamstack\n\nJamstack\n\nSSG and ISR are both forms of Jamstack. In both of these cases, our rendering process is done in advance. So instead of rendering the code on the client or server, we store the rendered code. That way, when our client requests data from the server, it receives a site as if the server had rendered it, but the server didn't spend any time doing so.\n\nBy rendering our code in advance, we remove the ability for bad actors to mess with our code and remove the time required for rendering from the equation. Leading to blazingly fast, secure sites. Additionally, platforms like Google are very fond of fast websites, so they tend to rank much better than their SSR and (especially) SPA counterparts.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nHopefully you're now feeling a bit more in the know on the latest and greatest in web. While all rendering methods do have their place, Jamstack is an excellent solution for building websites that your customers love to use.]n]nReady to build your very own Jamstack site?
