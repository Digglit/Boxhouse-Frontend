This exam is considered a right of passage for doctors as they work to complete their residency programs. After completing the step 3 USMLE exam, students are eligible to obtain their medical license.<br /><br />The software we helped to develop allows students to prepare for their exam by simulating a variety of different cases. These cases are medical environments in which students must order the correct exams and medications to successfully treat the patient. After completing the simulation, students receive feedback and a case grade which they can use to evaluate their performance.</p>
